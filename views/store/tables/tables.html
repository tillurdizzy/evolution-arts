			<h5>Options</h5>

			<p>Our solid hardwood table tops are hand made from 'Select & Better' grade hardwood lumber.  We use solid un-cut strips (no finger jointing little pieces) and assemble each block with a waterproof food safe adhesive.  You can order a table any way you like. Finished, un-finished, with edge round overs or profiles, square edge one side, etc.  We have many different species of hardwoods available, including Walnut, Cherry, Maple, Oak, Hickory, and Ash. We build edge grain (long strips) style blocks. From small cutting board sizes to large table top sizes. We can custom build almost any size up to 3â€³ thick.</p>
			<h6 style="margin-top:10px;">Types of Wood</h6>
